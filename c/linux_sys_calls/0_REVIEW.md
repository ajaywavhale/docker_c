## Review with Paras Sir

1. Why Sys calls are needed?
    a. Basically we differentiate Kernel (OS) from the appilcation code for many reasons, main being to protect the system and kernel from any faults in the application code
    b. SYS calls  are a method through which application code will ask for servicing from Kernel
    It is a way for application to interact with Server, 
    c. It is outside standard C lib, part of GNU/Linux
