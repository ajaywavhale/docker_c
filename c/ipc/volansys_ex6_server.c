/**
 * MEGA Exercise
 * Chat application [4.5 day, 30 points)
 * 
 * Develop a chat application using socket programming. Make sure to follow the amendments as followed:
 *  1. Multiple clients with a single server.
 *  2. Server should create a dynamic database for storing all the client data and should dynamically update the database based on the client connection –
 *       disconnection. – (Persistent storage is fine)
 *  3. Multiple clients can chat with each other – BUT, each message should be via server. 
 *      (Use multi-thread, queue for saving and sending older messages)
 *  4. Console based is fine.  No fancy UI required.
 * 
 * This exercise will include, file operations, socket programming, multhreaded communication, data structures and OS concepts. 
 * 
 * Before starting the above exercise, please prepare a document which would include top level architecture (flow chart containing function names) 
 * on how are you planning to implement the solution and get approval from the Mentor on the same.
