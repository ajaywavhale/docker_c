    "\n",
    "Usage requirements of a target parameters allow for far better control over a library or executable's link and include line while also giving more control over the transitive property of targets inside CMake.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will refactor our code from Adding a Library to use the modern CMake approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will let our library define its own usage requirements so they are passed transitively to other targets as necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, MathFunctions will specify any needed include directories itself. Then, the consuming target Tutorial simply needs to link to MathFunctions and not worry about any additional include directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, add a call to target_include_directories() in MathFunctions/CMakeLists. Remember that CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR is the path to the source directory currently being processed.\n",
    "\n",
